# Simplex mail

## Getting started

### gmail example

#### Set up your enviroment

Set these envrioment variables, recommended to use unix pass or similar to keep password safe
```bash
EMAIL_PASS="$(pass show emailPassword)"
EMAIL_SMTP=smtp://smtp.google.com:587
EMAIL_USERNAME="Real name"
EMAIL_USER="user@gmail..com"
```

In order to do this, you need to get an app password from google:
https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en

However other mail boxes will let you log in with your actual passwords
